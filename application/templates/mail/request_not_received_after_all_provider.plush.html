<p>A requester on <a href="<%= uiURL %>"><%= appName %></a> said they haven't received the item after all.</p>
<h4><a href="<%= postURL %>"><%= postTitle %></a></h4>
<p>The requester, <%= receiverNickname %>, initially said they received it from you but now have corrected that
    to say they haven't received it after all. You can chat with them <a href="<%= postURL %>">here</a>,
    if you need clarification.</p>
